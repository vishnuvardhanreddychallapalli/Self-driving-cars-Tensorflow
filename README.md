# Self-driving-cars-Tensorflow
Description This project is about building an end to end real-time deeplearning application that can predict the steering angle given an real time image of the car on the raod using the new Tensorflow and the NVIDIA Self drining car paper OpenCV. The sole idea of this project is to see how can a Convolutional neural network Perform on this dataset.The project depicts step to step building of a driving car as it is mentioned in the NVIDIA Self driving car paper.
# Tools used are:
1.Tensor Flow.
2.open cv
3.scipy
4.Numpy
